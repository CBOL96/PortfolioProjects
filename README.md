**Data Analytics Portfolio**

This repository showcases my data analytics projects, demonstrating skills in SQL, Python, data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. Each project highlights my ability to query, transform, and derive insights from data using industry-standard tools like SQL, Power BI, and Python.
**Projects:**
